# Dice-Simulator

Here's a simple dice simulator in Python that uses the random module:

Here's how the program works:

    We import the random module, which provides functions for generating random numbers.
    We define the number of sides on the dice as num_sides.
    We roll the dice using the random.randint() function, which generates a random integer between two given values (inclusive).
    We print the result of the roll using an f-string, which allows us to include the value of roll in the output.
